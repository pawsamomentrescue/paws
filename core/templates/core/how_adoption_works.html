    <h1>How Adoption Works</h1>
    <p>Our goal is to match each animal with a safe, loving home. Here's how the process works.</p>

    <ol class="steps">
        <li>
            <h3>1. View</h3>
            <p>Browse adoptable pets and shortlist animals that fit your lifestyle, home, and experience.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>2. Apply</h3>
            <p>Submit an adoption application so our team can understand your home, schedule, and preferences.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>3. Meet</h3>
            <p>We arrange a meet-and-greet with the pet, answer questions, and help you prepare for adoption.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
